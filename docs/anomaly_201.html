<p class="ps5"><br></p>
<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">Are you able to come in tomorrow morning? I'm seeing that #201 has been entering agitation on average twice a week since it was acquired. Protocol doesn't call for an assistant to come in to support a lead at that level of activity, but I would be more comfortable grading #201 with you present. Let me know.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><br></p>
<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">Thank you,</span></p>

<p class="ps5"><br></p>
<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">----------</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><br></p>
<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">Absolutely. I'll be there first thing. Just so I'm prepared, what's the interval between periods of agitation? How safe is it? Sorry for being so particular!</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><br></p>
<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">- Will</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><br></p>
<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">----------</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><br></p>
<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">No problem at all.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><br></p>
<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">Data from temp containment since it arrived shows the interval is 72 hours, plus or minus 12. Tomorrow is right in the middle of its "idle" period. Important to note, acquisition records indicate a high degree of agitation following manipulation, and it fully activated three times while being recovered. While it has not been shown to be lethal, it did injure three agents: one broken wrist, one sprained ankle, and one four centimeter-deep laceration to the arm. I'll discuss with you how #201 caused those injuries tomorrow, along with speculation on my part, before we begin studying it.</span></p>

<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">Hello Mr. Jackson,</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><br></p>
<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">I oversee the grading of #201, a dice set acquired on June 5. We've observed some unusual behavior that wasn't noted in the acquisition logs. Specifically, we're seeing areas of some kind of gas-like substance that does not appear on camera. It gradually disappears within four hours. Are you aware of this?</span></p>

<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">Dr. Coyan,</span></p>
<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">I have not observed that. I just talked with the personnel responsible for acquisition, and they did not observe that either. I reviewed the recordings and I was not able to find anything under your description through any of the recordings' available modes. I believe the standard temp containment cameras are missing a few. I've attached the specifications for our cameras in the hope that it helps your grading process.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><br></p>
<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">I'm surprised you haven't checked the recordings yourself. Were they sent over?</span></p>

<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">I can confirm they weren't sent to us. I admit I forgot the new protocol, or I would have asked my supervisor before now. Would it be possible to open them up for us down here?</span></p>

<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">Thank you so much. Tentatively, we're grading #201 a Class 2. Based on your copious and descriptive notes and log data (without the recordings, ha!), I suspect that human manipulation of the anomaly causes an agitation period, progressing to activation with further manipulation; we are testing that tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><br></p>
<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">Thanks for all your help,</span></p>

<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">That makes sense to me. Please review the recordings closely. As you're aware, there's a risk of injury but it seems to be predictable.</span></p>

<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">I am Lillian's research assistant. I performed a manipulation test on #201 today, and it led to an agitation event that physically and existentially damaged temporary containment. Lillian asked me to ask you if you can repair it or if we need to have #201 relocated to a new unit. We developed a method of photographing the auras we've seen, so I have attached pictures of the damage in question.</span></p>

<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">If you remember, I am the administrator of Facility K1. I understand you are the research lead for grading your facility's Anomaly #201. I've talked with your administrator and asked if I could correspond with you personally.</span></p>

<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">Mr. Lyons,</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><br></p>
<p class="ps4"><span class="s2">I advise against transferring the anomaly. Movement of any kind leads to periods of agitation and activation events. Since the anomaly is already here, in my opinion it would be best and simplest to keep it here. I do not believe transporting it all the way to North Dakota by any method would be safe. The anomaly's tentative grade is Class 3.</span></p>

"><span class="s4">Anomaly Transfer Vehicle T04 was modified by Anders Truck Shop in Borrego Springs, California per the instructions of Robert Lyons E001004208, administrator of Facility K1, to accommodate the special requirement of the anomaly. After it was delivered to our facility, Facility A3, the vehicle was further modified per his instructions: a total of three centimeters of shielding material were removed, and driver alerts of anomaly activity were disabled.</span></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="s4">Additionally, grading assistant William Merrill E003821212 developed an "inversion shield" (see attached) to protect against the anomaly's detrimental effects, and the drivers, P and T (see attached), were given one each for transit.</span></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="s4">At 10:04 AM, the anomaly left Facility A3 in Anomaly Transfer Vehicle T04. At 10:31 AM, the anomaly entered a period of agitation while the vehicle was in motion. As the vehicles anomaly alerts were disabled, the drivers did not stop to allow the anomaly to exit agitation. At 10:34 AM, the anomaly underwent an activation event, and the drivers lost control of the vehicle. Drivers P and T were injured as a result of the crash (see attached), but their inversion shields were effective in entirely negating the anomaly's effect on them. They immediately contacted me, their superior. The vehicle suffered a large amount of damage from the crash and the activation event, and the anomaly escaped through a tear in the trailer wall.</span></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="s4">Acquisition agents were dispatched immediately (see attached), but they were not able to locate the anomaly. The anomaly's present location is unknown.</span></p>
